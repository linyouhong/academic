abstract: "This study evaluated the long-term effects of early-life exposure to tropical cyclones on the socioeconomic performance of individuals. The data of individuals born in the coastal provinces in East and South China in 1963â€“1993 were merged with typhoon tracking data according to the birth time and place of each individual to identify significantly negative effects of gestational typhoon exposure on the educational attainment and annual income in adulthood. The effects were stronger for women than for men. The negative effects of typhoons became less significant after the rural reform, indicating that economic growth is crucial in mitigating the effects of natural disasters. Typhoon exposure was determined to increase pregnancy failure, suggesting that the long-term effects may be attributable to the detrimental effects of typhoon exposure on fetal development. Typhoon damage to agricultural production is also a potential cause."
